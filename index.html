Apologies for the confusion earlier. Let's make adjustments to ensure the burst characters are printed during the animation. Here's an updated version:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Animated Birthday Balloon</title>
</head>
<body>
  <script>
    const balloon = [
      "   .-~~~-.",
      "  /       \\",
      " |         |",
      "  \\       /",
      "   `.___.'",
      "     \\|/"
    ];

    const burst = [
      "💥",
      "💫",
      "✨",
      "🎉",
      "🥳"
    ];

    const animateBalloon = () => {
      let i = 0;
      let j = 0;
      const interval = setInterval(() => {
        console.clear();
        console.log(balloon.join('\n'));
        console.log("  🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈");
        if (i <= j && i < burst.length) {
          console.log(`   ${burst[i]}`);
          i++;
        } else {
          console.log("Happy Birthday!");
          clearInterval(interval);
        }
        j++;
      }, 500);
    };

    animateBalloon();
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

This code should now display the burst characters in the console log, one at a time, after the balloon, and eventually conclude with the "Happy Birthday!" message. Copy this code into an HTML file and view it in a browser's console to see the updated animation.
