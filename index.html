Creating animated effects within the console log using plain text can be challenging. However, I can provide a code snippet that simulates a simple party popper-like animation in the console log:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Animated Birthday Balloon</title>
</head>
<body>
  <script>
    const balloon = [
      "   .-~~~-.",
      "  /       \\",
      " |         |",
      "  \\       /",
      "   `.___.'",
      "     \\|/"
    ];

    const burst = [
      "ðŸ’¥",
      "ðŸ’«",
      "âœ¨",
      "ðŸŽ‰",
      "ðŸ¥³"
    ];

    const animateBalloon = () => {
      let i = 0;
      const interval = setInterval(() => {
        console.clear();
        console.log(balloon.join('\n'));
        console.log("  ðŸŽˆðŸŽˆðŸŽˆðŸŽˆðŸŽˆðŸŽˆðŸŽˆðŸŽˆ");
        console.log("Happy Birthday!");

        if (i === burst.length - 1) {
          clearInterval(interval);
          console.clear();
        }

        i++;
      }, 500);
    };

    animateBalloon();
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

This code will display a balloon in the console log along with a burst animation using emojis. It's a simulated animation by rapidly clearing and redrawing the console log content. Copy this code into an HTML file and view it in a browser's console to see the animation.
